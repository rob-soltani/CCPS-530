                            for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community
                            of
                            individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of

                            or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and
                            so
                            creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state
                            management
                            and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries."

                        <blockquote>

                            "MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ 'My S-Q-L')[5] is an open-source relational database management
                            system
                            (RDBMS).
                            Its name is a combination of 'My', the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and
                            'SQL',
                            the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into
                            one or more
                            data
                            tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the
                            data.
                            SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational
                            database,
                            as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL,
                            an RDBMS
                            like
                            MySQL
                            works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage
                            system,
                            manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and
                            creation of
                            backups.
                            MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database
                            using SQL, but more often MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that
                            need relational database capability. MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application
                            software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python.
                            MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and
                            WordPress. MySQL is also used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Flickr,
                            MediaWiki,
                            Twitter,and YouTube"
