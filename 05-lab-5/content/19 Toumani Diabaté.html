"Toumani Diabaté (born 10 August 1965) is a Malian kora player. 
In addition to performing the traditional music of Mali, he has also been involved in cross-cultural collaborations with 
flamenco, blues, jazz, and other international styles. 
Diabaté comes from a long family tradition of kora players, 
including his father Sidiki Diabaté, who recorded the first ever kora album in 1970. 
His family's oral tradition tells of 70 generations of musicians preceding him in a patrilineal line."
