"Philipp Koehn (born 1 August 1971 in Erlangen, West Germany) is a computer scientist and researcher in the field of machine translation.
His primary research interest is statistical machine translation and he is one of the inventors of a method called phrase based machine translation. 
This is a sub-field of statistical translation methods that employs sequences of words (or so-called "phrases") as the basis of translation, 
expanding the previous word based approaches."
