            "Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources,
            especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power,
            without direct active management by the user.
            The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.
            Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from
            central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge
            server"

            "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform,
            Amazon Web Services (AWS), that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer
            applications.
            EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot
            an
            Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance",
            containing any software desired. A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed,
            paying by the second for active servers â€“ hence the term "elastic". EC2 provides users with control over
            the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy.
            In November 2010, Amazon switched its own retail website platform to EC2 and AWS"

            Released on December 5, 2010, [1] it is part of Amazon.com's cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services
            (AWS).
            The name is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed, and a reference to
            U.S. Route 66.
            In addition to being able to route users to various AWS services, including EC2 instances, Route 53 also
            enables
            AWS customers to route users to non-AWS infrastructure and to monitor the health of their application and
            its endpoints.
            Route 53's servers are distributed throughout the world. Amazon Route 53 supports full, end-to-end DNS
            resolution over IPv6.
            Recursive DNS resolvers on IPv6 networks can use either IPv4 or IPv6 transport to send DNS queries to Amazon

            It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing
            resources
            required by that code. It was introduced in November 2014.
            The purpose of Lambda, as compared to AWS EC2, is to simplify building smaller, on-demand applications that
            are
            responsive to events and new information. AWS targets starting a Lambda instance within milliseconds of an
            event.
            Node.js, Python, Java, Go,[2] Ruby,[3] and C# (through .NET Core) are all officially supported as of 2018.
            In late 2018, custom runtime support[4] was added to AWS Lambda, giving developers the ability to run a

            "Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.
            It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and
            it is now their flagship offering for app development.
            Firebase evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011.
            Envolve provided developers an API that enables the integration of online chat functionality into their
            websites. After releasing the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used to
            pass application data that were not chat messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application
            data such as game state in real time across their users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat
            system and the real-time architecture that powered it. They founded Firebase as a separate company in
            September 2011 and it launched to the public in April 2012"
