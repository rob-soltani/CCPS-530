"React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end,
JavaScript library
for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and
a community
of
individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the
development of
single-page
or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to
the DOM, and
so
creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for
state
management
and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries."
