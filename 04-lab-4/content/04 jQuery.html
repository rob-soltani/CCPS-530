"jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and
manipulation,
as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source
software using
the permissive MIT License. As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10
million most
popular websites. Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed
JavaScript
library
by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other
JavaScript
library."
