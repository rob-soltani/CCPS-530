# CCPS 530 - Web Systems Development - Fall 2020

### What is this repo about?
This repository contains my lab submissions and course project submission for the CCPS 530 - Web Systems Development course at Ryerson University.

### Project: IP Location
It is a web service that takes in an internet IP address from the user and calls IPFind.com in the back-end and displays the location with which the IP is associated  on a map (Google) along with some other data.

### Project: Stack
The project uses NodeJS and Express hosted on a Firebase Cloud Function. It also uses Firestore as a database. The front-end is built with React, Redux, and Bootstrap.
